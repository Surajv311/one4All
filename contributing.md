# Contributing Guidelines

- Kindly raise an issue before sending a PR.
- Please check if the opportunity or resource already exists in the repo before sending a pull request in the ```README.md``` file. 
- Your PR must include: the title of the opportunity or resource, brief info about it & its link, followed by the #issue it resolves. 
- Please refrain from sharing opportunities that require a down payment. 
- All the resources/opportunities are shared in the ```README.md``` file itself. So if you have an amazing resource or opportunity to share, then send a PR to the ```README.md``` file. The changes would be incorporated into the website soon. If you have any recommendations to improve the [website](https://one4all.netlify.app/), then go ahead to raise an issue.  
- The repository consists of opportunities that are available periodically. Eg. GSOC (which opens once every year). So kindly share those opportunities which sync with this.  
- For **Resources section**: Please send a PR to the corresponding repository linked to this repository. <br>
  Eg. If you have a resource that could be used for interview preparation then send a PR to the linked repo, which is [this](https://github.com/Uncodedtech/Interviewprep). 
- For any other doubts, feel free to raise an issue.
